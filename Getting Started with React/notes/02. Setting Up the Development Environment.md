# Setting Up the Development Environment

In this section, we'll guide your students through setting up their development environment for the React and TypeScript course. We'll cover the basics of IDEs and text editors, and we'll specifically focus on using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the primary code editor. Additionally, we'll show how to install Node.js, which is essential for running and building React applications.

## What is an IDE and Text Editor?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a Text Editor are both tools used by developers to write, edit, and manage code. They serve as the primary interface for coding and provide various features to improve the development experience.

### Teaching Approach

- Explain the difference between an IDE and a Text Editor:
  - An IDE typically includes features like code completion, debugging, and project management.
  - A Text Editor is usually lightweight, with fewer built-in features, making it highly customizable and extensible with plugins.

**Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**

Visual Studio Code is a popular and powerful code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers an ideal environment for developing React applications, as it's highly extensible and comes with a rich ecosystem of extensions.

### Teaching Approach

- Discuss the benefits of using VSCode:
  - It's free, open-source, and available on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
  - VSCode supports a wide range of programming languages and extensions, making it versatile for different projects.

**Installing Visual Studio Code**

1. Visit the official VSCode website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Follow the installation instructions for your OS.

**Installing Node.js**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that's crucial for building and running React applications.

### Teaching Approach

- Explain the necessity of Node.js for React development, as it allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser.

**For Windows and macOS:**

1. Visit the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version, as it's more stable and recommended for most use cases.

3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

**For Linux:**

You can install Node.js via the package manager. For example, using the APT package manager on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Ensure npm (Node Package Manager) is installed as well:

```bash
sudo apt install npm
```

By following these steps, your students will have a well-configured development environment with VSCode and Node.js, making them ready to start coding with React and TypeScript.
