# How React Works

In this section, we'll delve into the inner workings of React, covering concepts like the component tree, Virtual DOM, the relationship between React and ReactDOM, and the use of `StrictMode`. We'll also touch upon React Native briefly.

## Component Tree

Explain that React applications are composed of a component tree, where each component represents a part of the user interface. Components can contain other components, forming a hierarchical structure that reflects the structure of the user interface.

## Virtual DOM vs. Real DOM (How React Updates Virtual DOM)

- Describe the Virtual DOM as a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
- Mention that React creates a Virtual DOM tree that mirrors the structure of the component tree.
- When data changes, React calculates the difference (diffing) between the old Virtual DOM and the new one.
- This difference is then applied to the real DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed, reducing unnecessary DOM manipulations.

## How React and ReactDOM Library Work Together

React and ReactDOM are two separate libraries that work together to enable React applications in web environments.

- React is responsible for creating and managing the component tree, updating the Virtual DOM, and handling component logic.
- ReactDOM is specific to web environments and provides the functionality to render React components into the real DOM and handle events and interactions.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

In this code snippet:

- `ReactDOM.createRoot` is used to create a root element in the real DOM where the React application will be rendered.
- `<React.StrictMode>` is a wrapper component that activates additional checks and warnings during development. It helps catch potential issues and prepares applications for future React updates.

## What is `StrictMode`

`StrictMode` is a component provided by React that enables a set of development features like double-invocation checks and component side-effect warnings. It's used during development to help identify potential problems in a React application.

## Brief Explanation of React Native

Introduce React Native as a framework for building mobile applications using React. Explain that it allows developers to write components in React and have them translated into native components, resulting in a cross-platform development experience.

### Teaching Approach

- Mention that React Native can be used to build apps for both iOS and Android platforms.
- Discuss its benefits, such as code reusability, a single codebase for multiple platforms, and a strong developer community.

By covering these key points, your students will gain a deeper understanding of how React works, the importance of the Virtual DOM, and the relationship between React and ReactDOM. Additionally, they'll be introduced to the benefits of `StrictMode` and React Native.
