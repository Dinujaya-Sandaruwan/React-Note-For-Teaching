# Creating a React App

In this section, we'll walk your students through the process of creating a React app, using the Vite build tool, and focusing on function components. We'll also cover component naming conventions, JSX, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and how to work with variables and conditionals in React components.

## How to Create a React App

We'll cover how to create a React app on Windows, Linux, and macOS using Vite, a popular build tool.

### Teaching Approach

- Explain that Vite is a build tool that provides a fast development experience with instant server start and hot module replacement.
- Provide installation instructions for Vite and mention its benefits, including efficient ES modules and automatic configuration.

**For Windows, Linux, and macOS:**

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app.

3. Run the following command to create a new Vite project:

```bash
npm init @vitejs/app my-react-app --template react
```

4. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

## Class Components vs. Function Components

In this course, we'll focus on using function components for creating React components. Explain that function components are a modern way of defining components and are recommended for new projects.

## Naming Conventions for Classes and Functions

Emphasize the importance of clear and meaningful naming for classes and function components. Follow a naming convention like PascalCase for component names, such as `MyComponent`.

## Create Your First Component - Message.tsx

Demonstrate how to create a simple React component that renders "Hello world" inside an `h1` tag. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Message() {
  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}

export default Message;
```

## What is JSX (Babel JS) and How React Compiles JSX

Explain that JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. JSX is transpiled into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel. React uses JSX to define components and their structure.

## What is HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

Teach students about Hot Module Replacement (HMR) as a feature provided by Vite and other build tools. It allows for real-time updates to the application without a full reload, making development more efficient.

## How to Use Variables Inside Components and How to Use "{}" for Conditionals

Show students how to use variables inside React components and how to use curly braces `{}` to embed JavaScript expressions. Additionally, demonstrate how to use conditional rendering in React components.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  const name = 'John';
  const showGreeting = true;

  return (
    <div>
      {showGreeting && <p>Hello, {name}!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
```

By covering these topics, your students will have a strong foundation in creating React apps, understanding JSX, and working with components efficiently.
